A basic setup for quickly testing [react-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) in an AMD environment.

This is currently testing the individual modules, to test the built file change
	require( ['react','react-bootstrap']
to
	require( ['react','react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap']
